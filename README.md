# About me
## A pacifist by nature, I have embarked upon this new chapter quite late in life as I discovered my interest in data and the many stories it can narrate.
## As I slowely but surely make my way through this newly encountered universe, I pace myself to embrace all that it can offer and whatever I find it in my capcacity to learn, such as this README file I just created as an intro.

## Always happy to make new connects for collaborations or otherwise.
